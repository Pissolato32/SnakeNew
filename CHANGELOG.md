# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Snake Growth:** Snakes now grow visually after eating food. This was fixed by ensuring `maxLength` and `radius` updates are sent from the server to the client.
- **Collision Detection:** Re-enabled snake-on-snake collision. This was fixed by correcting the `SpatialHashing` grid size to ensure nearby players are correctly identified for collision checks.
- **HTML Fixes:** Fixed syntax errors in index.html (invalid tags, profiler structure).
- **SpatialGrid Fix:** Added NaN checks in getNearby to prevent TypeError.
- **CircularBuffer Import:** Fixed ES6 import/export for client compatibility.

### Added
- Detailed technical explanations in commit messages to document the reasoning behind key changes.
- `DEBUG_MODE` flag for easier debugging.
- Lag compensation for player collision detection.
- **Infrastructure Base:** Created Logger, ErrorHandler, Config, Metrics systems.
- **Shared Components:** Implemented CircularBuffer, Constants.client.js for code consolidation.
- **Profiler Adjustments:** Moved profiler panel to right side, added display toggle, repositioned leaderboard to left.
- **Security & Validation:** Implemented Validator for input validation (movement, nicknames).

### Changed
- Refactored `GameLoop.js` to import the `Constants` module directly for better code clarity.

### Pending Tasks

### Implementation Plan

#### Overview
This plan aims to fix bugs, glitches, and inconsistencies in the SnakeNew multiplayer snake game application, ensuring it functions correctly and efficiently. The project consists of a Node.js server with socket.io and a client-side game interface. The plan covers codebase improvements, module system consistency, gameplay logic fixes, performance optimizations, and testing strategies.

#### Types
The project uses JavaScript with ES modules. Key data structures include Player, Food, Powerup, and GameState objects. Types will be clarified and documented where needed, including player state, AI states, and network message formats.

#### Files
- Existing files to modify:
  - `server.js`: Ensure ES module imports and server startup robustness.
  - `GameManager.js`: Verify correct initialization and dependency injection.
  - `PlayerManager.js`: Fix player creation, bot management, and spatial hashing usage.
  - `FoodManager.js`: Confirm food pooling and spatial hashing correctness.
  - `PowerupManager.js`: Review powerup spawning and effects.
  - `CollisionSystem.js`: Fix collision detection logic and edge cases.
  - `NetworkManager.js`: Ensure efficient delta updates and socket event handling.
  - `GameLoop.js`: Verify game tick logic, AI updates, and dynamic entity management.
  - `AIManager.js`: Confirm AI behavior tree correctness and bot steering logic.
  - `Constants.js`: Add missing constants and verify values.
  - `Utils.js`: Validate utility functions used across modules.
  - `game.js`: Fix client-side rendering, input handling, and performance profiling.
  - `BehaviorTree.js`: Confirm behavior tree implementation correctness.
  - `CircularBuffer.js` and `SpatialHashing.js`: Ensure correct ES module exports and usage.
- Configuration updates:
  - `package.json`: Confirm dependencies and scripts for ES module support and testing.

#### Functions
- Modified functions:
  - PlayerManager: `createPlayer`, `addBot`, `initBots` for bot management fixes.
  - CollisionSystem: `processCollisions` for robust collision detection.
  - NetworkManager: `sendGameUpdates` for optimized delta updates.
  - GameLoop: `start` and `initGame` for game tick and entity management.
  - AIManager: `update` and behavior tree actions for bot behavior improvements.
  - game.js: Rendering loop, input handlers, and profiler updates.

#### Classes
- Modified classes:
  - GameManager: Ensure proper ES module import/export and initialization.
  - PlayerManager, FoodManager, PowerupManager, CollisionSystem, NetworkManager, GameLoop, AIManager: Fix ES module syntax and internal logic as needed.

#### Dependencies
- No new dependencies planned.
- Confirm existing dependencies (`express`, `socket.io`, `compression`, `jest`) are correctly installed and used.

#### Testing
- Use existing Jest tests in `__tests__` folder.
- Add tests for critical game logic if missing.
- Manual testing by running server and connecting client to verify gameplay, UI, and network behavior.

#### Implementation Order
1. Fix ES module import/export syntax across all files for consistency.
2. Verify and fix server startup in `server.js`.
3. Fix PlayerManager and bot management logic.
4. Fix FoodManager and PowerupManager entity management.
5. Fix CollisionSystem collision detection and player death handling.
6. Fix NetworkManager socket event handling and delta updates.
7. Fix GameLoop timing, AI updates, and dynamic entity management.
8. Fix AIManager behavior tree and bot steering logic.
9. Fix client-side `game.js` rendering, input, and profiler.
10. Verify constants and utility functions.
